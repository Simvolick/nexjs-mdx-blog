This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

First, you need to set up your environment variables for the Airtable integration:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
2. Add your Airtable API key:
```bash
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your_airtable_api_key_here
```

You can get your Airtable API key from [https://airtable.com/account](https://airtable.com/account).

### Run the Development Server

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/airtable](http://localhost:3000/api/airtable). This endpoint can be edited in `src/app/api/airtable/route.js`.

The `src/app/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
