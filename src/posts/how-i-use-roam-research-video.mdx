## ROAM Research

I have wanted to share the way that I have used [ROAM Research](https://roamresearch.com/) for a while now.

When you first open ROAM research it can seem confusing. You get no hints and no one is there to guide and tell you of how to actually use this tool.

- What are the best practices? 
- What can you do that other software such as Notion can't? 
- How do you transfer all your notes from Notion to ROAM research?

The problem is that when you open up ROAM you only get a blank screen in front of you will little to no information.

You click on the question mark icon it does nothing but confuse you even more.

To the veteran, user ROAM research can be one of the best and the only tool that boosts productivity and improves well being. But to new users instead, the lack of tutorials and easy to understand interface is a reason why they run back to Notion.

### After using ROAM research for 3 years
 
The more I have been using it, the more amazed I have become.
 
The possibilities that open up for you when you use ROAM are incredible. And the most fantastic thing is that you only need to know about the [[ ]] feature to start.
 
At this point, the magic will start.
 
ROAM works because you can put anything into the square brackets, and it becomes a hyperlink.
 
You didn’t put the word into the square brackets? It still gets indexed into the database inside of ROAM as an unlinked reference.
 
The basics of it is that you don’t need to be a genius to use it. And to get the full benefit of ROAM Research, simply using it allows you to start working towards a centralised storage system slowly.
 
For me, the most annoying thing was constantly losing the information that I wanted saved. 
 
Now that I have ROAM, there is no chance that I will ever forget about something.
