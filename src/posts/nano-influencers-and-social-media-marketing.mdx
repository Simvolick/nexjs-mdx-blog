# Improve your social media marketing strategy by using Nano Influencers

Two identical skincare startups launched their Instagram campaigns on the same Monday morning in September 2020. Both had $10K marketing budgets, similar products, and the same target demographic of women aged 25-35.

Company A hired Kim Kardashian's makeup artist for one sponsored post. The gorgeous content reached 2.4 million people, generated 50K likes, and looked absolutely stunning in their media kit. The founder felt like they'd made it to the big leagues.

Company B took a different approach. They reached out to 50 women with 2,000-8,000 followers each‚Äîreal people with real lives who genuinely cared about skincare. Teachers, yoga instructors, working moms, college students. People whose friends actually trusted their recommendations.

Three months later, the results were shocking:

Company A: 12 sales, $1,440 revenue, -$8,560 loss
Company B: 187 sales, $22,440 revenue, +$12,440 profit

The difference wasn't just in the numbers‚Äîit was in the quality of engagement. Company A's comments were filled with generic "üòç" emojis from bots and admirers who would never buy anything. Company B's posts sparked real conversations: "Does this really work for sensitive skin?" "I've been using this for two weeks and my breakouts are gone!" "Where can I buy this?"

This is the power of nano influencer marketing, and it's revolutionizing how smart brands connect with customers in an increasingly skeptical digital world.

## Who are Nano Influencers and why does it matter

The social media marketing landscape has evolved far beyond the early days of celebrity endorsements and mega-influencer partnerships. Today's consumers are smarter, more skeptical, and increasingly immune to obvious advertising. They've learned to scroll past perfectly polished sponsored content from accounts with millions of followers.

Do you know that an average instagram user has 150 followers? That has been only growing with time as accounts get abandoned and new accounts get created.

Nano influencer is a blogger who has from 1 000 - 10 000 followers.üí™ Those are friends and real life connections. They are highly engaged with the account and read every word their friend says.

The new trend is not advertising once with the big boys and girls, who has more than 1 million followers. The new trend is advertising 365 days a year with a nano influencer.

The categories of Influencers:

- **Nano-influencers**: 1,000 - 10,000 followers ‚úÖ
- **Micro-influencers**: 10,000 - 50,000 followers ü§ó
- **Mid-tier influencers**: 50,000 - 500,000 followers ü§§
- **Macro-influencers**: 500,000 - 1,000,000 followers ü§†
- **Mega-influencers**: 1,000,000+ followers ü§ë

## Benefits of using NANO

As I already said it sucks when your favourite blogger or someone you admire starts writing about their daily life and how a specific product helped them. I hate that BS.

But when my friend on instagram tags a dry cleaner who helped him get the worst stain of his favourite hoodie.
<br/>
Or my love from school posts story where she says that she has never seen better service than in a specific shop.
<br/>
I really follow those pages and next time I need to clean, or buy something I will remember what they recommended.

Think about yourself. Who is more likely to influence your choice on cereal brand. 10 close real life friends or LeBron James?

The nano influencers has a specific and very deep niche of followers. There are also so many of those unbotted nano influencers that you have as much choice as you want. Doesn't matter who is your target.

There was an article in New York Times about phenomena of Nano-influencers.

`‚ÄúTheir lack of fame is one of the qualities that make them approachable,‚Äù says author of the New York Times' piece. ‚ÄúWhen they recommend a shampoo or a lotion or a furniture brand on Instagram, their word seems as genuine as advice from a friend.‚Äù`

Also one of the best parts for a business is that a free trial or a sample of a product will be enough to agree on terms of advertising.

No one is coming to them every day offering partnership. If you are the first to contact them, a nano influencer has NO IDEA how much it actually costs to advertise. Even asking for money will feel wrong as they might think their story post has no value to your brand.

In 2018 nano influencer wasn't even a term:

That is why it is one of the best ways to advertise online right now. It doesn't matter what social network we are talking about, but Instagram, Twitter and Facebook are surely the best platforms to use nano influencers at.

## How to find Nano influencers

One of the easiest ways is to find already good service which provides you with list of influencers looking to earn with sponsored posts. This would be leveraging the most annoying work of sending DM's on Instagram and getting into shadow ban for getting blocked too many times.

Another way is to leverage this to someone else like a small marketing agency or a VA who can follow a script and reach out to the influencers.

One of the ways to guarantee yourself finding up and coming nano influencers is to follow specific hashtags.

One of the most used hashtags by those who are looking to be sponsored is \#discoverunder10k

You can check both Top and Recent to find the best fit for your niche.

Another way would be to look for related accounts when following a nano influencer. Usually they follow each over and make a niche circle around themselves. Something similar to a community.

Something that will give away an inpiring influencer is:

- **Interests & Specialties In Instagram Bio**:
<br/>
Nano-influencers have a very specific niche and they have a lifestyle or values they identify themselves and also their followers. This is a great way to check if your brand and their way of thinking has any cross references and if it makes sense for you to collaborate.

- **Photography**:
<br/>
A looking-to-be nano influencers have a very specificly orgonised or styled pictures and albums. Those are usually specific to their interests and niche but general pattern is usually present.

- **Highlights**:
<br/>
Highlights is a go to identifier of a nano-influencer. As they already have a relatively big followage, their way to engage more users and increase their following was the highlights as it allows you to share some stories and experiences to engage people more fully. Sometimes even a previous integration with another brand is present in the highlights.

- **Contact Information**:
<br/>
The way for nano-influencer to be contacted and to be sponsored is to provide easy contact information. So if an email or a phone is present do not shine away from going away from instagram(I would use everything as to not get ignored).

Examples:

 MEGAN VADNAIS - 9 961 FOLLOWERS

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <InstagramEmbed url="https://www.instagram.com/p/CFIwNsBJ0MZ/" width={328} />
</div>

<br/>

HAILEY KNOTT - 4 138 FOLLOWERS:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>

## Remington campaign

One of the best nano influencers campaigns was Remington's official social promotion strategy. They posted it on their website and promoted it through word of mouth. The guidelines were:

- Take a photo of yourself using the curling wand, ensuring the entire product is in the shot
- Tag the brand's handle (**@RemingtonUK**)
- Use the brand hashtag (**#HairToBeDifferent**)
- Include an FTC disclosure (**#Sponsored, in this case #gifted**)
- Share the product's value proposition (**‚Äúthe new product's heat settings protect against hair damage‚Äù**)

## Calculating the results

Every business and marketer is spending money to get more money back. Long term or short term. The way to make sure that you are getting at least your money back after each influencer marketing and social marketing campaigns is to calculate ROI. üìà

![formula image](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/1d6dbe_9771ee10b5bb4bc1a6cf92bbf5a34c9f~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_580,h_167,al_c,lg_1,q_80/1d6dbe_9771ee10b5bb4bc1a6cf92bbf5a34c9f~mv2.webp)

If you see that your Return on Investment is too small or smaller than compared to working with micro or macro influencers than check your strategy and basic assumption.

`Test. Test. Test. And than Test some more.`

Every business has it's own specifics and there is no single right way to go about social media marketing. But it is very easy on figuring it out. Just try it out and see for yourself.

Please tell me by email what you think! Tweet at me. DM me.

I am always open for discussions.

Have a nice day. [Klim Yadrintsev](https://twitter.com/yadrintsevklim) üòâ
