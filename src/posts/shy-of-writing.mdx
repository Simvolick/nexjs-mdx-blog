## Being worried about doing a wrong thing

Over the past few months and even weeks, I have barely written anything on my main website.

A part of the reason why I haven't has been the fact that I was worried for some insane reason that I would be judged.

It is a wrong mentality that I know is wrong, but it didn't save me from making this mistake.

If I look at the blog posts and things that I have written, it becomes certain that one more blog post full of my personal feelings won't change a thing.

The klimy.co was supposed to be initially a portfolio website that I have made on one of the Django tutorials on udemy. 

It has become a huge part of my life that I have relied on heavily over the past year and is a thing that has shown me and taught me a lot.

The second thing that made me reluctant to write was the topics of choice that I have decided to write about.

As my resolution a couple of months ago, I decided that this blog has to have some real topic and description that I write about.

The topic of choice was economics, and it was one of the most exciting things that I was an expert on and can talk a lot about.

The hard part was that I never found a good and interesting economics blog that I have even tried reading. So the content and what to write about without being fully academic was hard to find.

Or at least, I didn't look for it hard enough.

That is why without a topic, it seemed quite wrong to start writing my personal thinking and ideas once again.

Now that I think about it, do I now write more, because it feels like it is pointless? It feels like, no one hears my writing either way.

And I also can not give enough time to my writing for it to be worth the time that people should spend reading.

## What the blog was for me before and what it has become

### Before

Before, the blog was some type of sanctuary in the world where I had no one to speak with while I was living in a foreign country. I tried to express myself and communicate with the world while at the same time improving my writing skill.

Back when I had just started, it seemed that I surrounded myself with an information bubble of writers and creators. I didn't know any better. It seemed that everyone was writing and everyone was creating.

It was a great time to be alive. I even started freelancing as a software engineer and a programmer. I even closed my first deal!

But things came to a push, and instead, I started doing some other work that went quite far away from writing and creating.

### Now

To be honest, I am not sure what I am supposed to be writing here anymore.

Is it a blog that can help me academically and, in other ways, help me communicate my achievements?

Is it a way for me to learn and experiment? 

Should I still be writing about economics, even though it didn't work for me for the past three months, or should I try writing about cryptocurrencies and web 3.0? Or should it be nft world and coding on the Solana network?

I am not really sure.

I know for a fact, though, that I need to write. It is the only thing that I can do freely with no preparation, and it is a thing that makes me feel as if I am alive.

I want to write blog posts like this, but I also want to share info and insights that I think you won't find anywhere.

## What I am up to right now

If you are interested, right now, Klim Yadrintsev is doing his pre-program for the MFE course at HAAS Berkley.

I am on the waiting list for the program and will hopefully get a place there as soon as possible.

If for some reason, I don't, I will be trying to apply to other universities for the MFE program as well.

HAAS Berkley has a fantastic program that is heavily economics focused and is a perfect fit for my own way of learning. Hopefully, I will be able to get in.

If not, I will consider my other options. One of them is a data science world that I have already become fluent in with Kaggle competitions and on the job work that heavily requires me to do DS.

All in all, I know that I have a bright future. I hope that this blog will be an integral part of my success and growth.
